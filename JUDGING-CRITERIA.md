# Judging Criteria

[https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030.html](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030.html)

**As there are 17 goals, need the teams to first specify which goal they are addressing.** Do we want teams to be able to tackle multiple goals at once, or just focus on one?

**_Marks will be presented to judges from a scale of 1 - 5, we will then scale the mark up accordingly. Total mark out of 50_**

* **Effectiveness (15)**

How well does the project tackle the goal? Will it completely solve the goal, make significant strides to achieve the goal, address a smaller (but still important) part of the goal, or just scratch the surface of the goal?

* Example: Goal 2 (No Hunger)

    * Completely solves the goal - a project which can provide food to literally every human on the planet

    * Significant strides to achieve the goal - a project which can provide food to the countries that need the food the most

    * Addresses a smaller part of the goal - a project which can provide food to target demographics (e.g. local homeless)

    * Scratches the surface - a project which can provide food to a select few people

    * (not expecting people to solve world hunger)

        * (but would be cool!)

* **Viability/Feasibility (10)**

If the project were to be rolled-out in the real world, how viable would it actually be? Would it be feasible in terms of **time, cost & scale**? Or is it a bit too idealistic to be implemented realistically? If the goal concerns people in developing countries, does the project properly take their needs into account?

* **Technical Prowess	 (15)**

Is the project technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building it?** Does it actually work**, is it a barely functional prototype, or is it completely smoke and mirrors?

* **Originality**** (5)
**Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/web/IoT solution? Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?

* **Presentation (5)
**How effective was the presentation at conveying the team's approach to their chosen goal? Was it easy to understand the problem domain and how exactly the project has taken steps in tackling it?
